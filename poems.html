        <h3>Behind the Smile</h3>
        <p>
          Emotionally, I can't do it anymore,<br />
          I'm worn down to the core.<br />
          Morally drained, like I’ve given my all,<br />
          Spiritually numb, I feel so small.<br />
        <br>
          Physically, I'm smiling, face intact,<br />
          But inside me, there’s a painful crack.<br />
          On the surface, everything looks alright,<br />
          But darkness swallows me each night.<br />
        <br>
          They see the grin, the charm, the light,<br />
          Not the battles I fight out of sight.<br />
          They cheer the mask I’ve learned to wear,<br />
          Not knowing the weight of silent despair.<br />
        <br>
          It’s hard sometimes, breathing through pain,<br />
          Walking through fire, dancing in rain.<br />
          But if these words can hold my cry,<br />
          Let them speak the truth I hide inside.

        <h3>Good evening</h3>
        <p>
          In the gentle whispers of the evening's breeze,<br />
          I find myself lost in thoughts of you, at ease.<br />
          As the stars twinkle, painting the night sky blue,<br />
          I realize how much I'll miss you.<br />
        <br>
          Your laughter, a melody that dances in my mind,<br />
          Your smile, a beacon that's so kind.<br />
          With every moment that we shared, I knew,<br />
          In your absence, I'll deeply miss you.<br />
        <br>
          Though our paths may diverge, for now,<br />
          I'll hold onto memories, I'll allow<br />
          My heart to treasure every glance, every smile,<br />
          Knowing that distance only lasts for a while.<br />
        <br>
          So as the days pass and time slips away,<br />
          I'll carry your presence in my heart every day.<br />
          And though I'll miss you, this much is true,<br />
          I'll hold onto hope, until I see you anew.

        <h3>Rainy days</h3>
        <p>
          Raindrops tap the windowpane,<br />
          A quiet song, a sweet refrain.<br />
          They fall like thoughts I left behind,<br />
          The ones I keep inside my mind.<br />
        <br>
          Each drop a name I used to know,<br />
          Each streak a place I couldn’t go.<br />
          The sky, it weeps what I won’t say,<br />
          And somehow that still feels okay.<br />
        <br>
          There’s calm within this gentle sound,<br />
          A kind of peace that wraps around.<br />
          It doesn’t judge, it doesn’t pry,<br />
          It lets me breathe, it lets me cry.<br />
        <br>
          The past returns in shades of gray,<br />
          But here, I let it drift away.<br />
          And though it hurts, it hurts so kind,<br />
          Like rain that cleans a cluttered mind.<br />
        <br>
          So let it pour, I’ll sit and stay,<br />
          And let the silence wash the day.<br />
          For in the rain, I’m not alone,<br />
          It feels a little like coming home.<br/>

        <h3>Barely Alive, Still Holding On</h3>
        <p>
          I want to die, but not tonight,<br />
          There’s still a flicker, still a fight.<br />
          Not for me, I’ve long been torn,<br />
          But I can’t bear to see them mourn.<br />
        <br>
          I tread the edge, this tightrope line,<br />
          Where tears fall soft and smiles shine.<br />
          A mask that keeps the world at bay,<br />
          While I survive from day to day.<br />
        <br>
          I’ve made some plans, I’ve spoken dreams,<br />
          But now they feel like distant schemes.<br />
          Yet even in this hollow space,<br />
          Hope lingers in some quiet place.<br />
        <br>
          My soul is thin, my body's sore,<br />
          Each breath I take, I feel no more.<br />
          But still I rise, and still I go,<br />
          Afraid to leave, yet tired to show.<br/>
        <br>
          I think of all I haven't done,<br />
          Of golden things beneath the sun.<br />
          The people who would break and cry,<br />
          If they had to ask the reason why.<br/>
        <br>
          So here I am, not whole but true,<br />
          A wounded soul just seeing through.<br />
          And though the night feels far too long,<br />
          I stay...for them, I still hold on.<br/>

        <h3>Five Years Between</h3>
        <p>
          For five long years, I've stood my ground,<br />
          While silence screamed without a sound.<br />
          While emptiness, a shadowed hole,<br />
          Tried hard to feast upon my soul.<br />
        <br>
          It’s like I breathe, but never feel,<br />
          A ghost that walks on turning wheels.<br />
          Alive, they say... but not quite right,<br />
          I flicker soft beneath the light.<br />
        <br>
          A hollow shell in crowded rooms,<br />
          I dress in smiles, perfume my gloom.<br />
          But no one sees the fractured seam,<br />
          Or how I blur inside a dream.<br />
        <br>
          This soul of mine... so paper thin,<br />
          Caught somewhere not quite out, not in.<br />
          I’m tethered by a thread so small,<br />
          Between the living and the fall.<br/>
        <br>
          I’ve tried to speak, to scream, to write,<br />
          But all that comes is black and white. <br />
          And when I beg to just let go,<br />
          Something whispers, “not yet, though.”<br/>
        <br>
          So here I stay, not brave, not bold,<br />
          Just tired eyes and hands gone cold. <br />
          A body still, a heart half-dead, <br />
          A war inside my weary head.<br/>
        <br>
          And still, I walk. And still, I breathe.<br />
          Though all I crave is sweet release.<br />
          Not death, no...just a softer way,<br />
          To rest this ache I hide each day.<br/>
        <br>
          So if you see me, know this truth:<br />
          I've fought this fight since fragile youth.<br />
          I am not weak... I’m battle-torn,<br />
          A silent storm, forever worn.

        <h3>Please Find Me</h3>
        <p>
          I’m here, but not where eyes can see,<br />
          A fading voice inside of me.<br />
          I speak in sighs, I walk in haze,<br />
          A ghost still trapped in living days.<br />
        <br>
          I laugh on cue, I nod on time,<br />
          But none of it has felt like mine.<br />
          I fill the space, I play the part,<br />
          But something’s hollow in my heart.<br />
        <br>
          I leave small clues in things I write,<br />
          In late-night thoughts, in sleepless nights.<br />
          I hope someone might read between,<br />
          The lines where I have truly been.<br />
        <br>
          I wear this pain like second skin,<br />
          Too worn to cry, too loud within.<br />
          I smile so no one sees the plea,<br />
          Behind each breath: "please, someone see."<br/>
        <br>
          Not to fix, or save, or mend,<br />
          But just to know, just to befriend.<br />
          To look me in the eyes and say,<br />
          "I’ve felt that too...I'll help you stay."<br/>
        <br>
          So if you pass me in the crowd,<br />
          And see a soul not speaking loud,<br />
          Don’t wait for signs or words to flee,<br />
          Just stop and ask... “Is that you?”<br/>
          Please find me.

        <h3>I Know... But I'm Tired</h3>
        <p>
          I know the sun will rise again,<br />
          That stormy nights don't always win.<br />
          I know there's light beyond this ache,<br />
          That broken things can still remake.<br />
        <br>
          I know that healing takes its time,<br />
          And peace can come without a sign.<br />
          I know that hope’s a fragile thread,<br />
          Still glowing when all else feels dead.<br />
        <br>
          But, God...I'm tired, bone-deep worn,<br />
          Like pages bent and edges torn..<br />
          I wake with weight I cannot name,<br />
          And smile through echoes just the same.<br />
          <br>
            I hold on tight, I always do,<br />
            But some days feel too much, too true.<br />
            I whisper dreams through heavy breath, <br />
            While dancing inches close to death.<br/>
          <br>
            It’s not that I have given in,<br />
            But I don’t know where to begin.<br />
            I hope, I do... but hope is thin,<br />
            When all I feel is worn-out skin.<br/>
          <br>
            So if I pause, or take a knee,<br />
            Don’t think I’ve lost what’s left of me.<br />
            I’m not yet gone, just seeking fire,<br />
            I know...  <br />
            I hope... <br/>
            But, man~ I’m tired.

        <h3>To the One Who Still Stands</h3>
        <p>
          To the version of me who refuses to fall, <br />
          Who stands on the edge and still answers the call. <br />
          With bones that feel brittle, with breath running thin,<br />
          You carry a war that rages within.<br />
        <br>
          You walk through the fire with no one to cheer,<br />
          No medals, no songs, just silence and fear.<br />
          But still, step by step, you keep moving on,<br />
          While part of you whispers, “I shouldn’t be gone.”<br />
        <br>
          You’ve mastered the art of smiling through pain,<br />
          Of dancing in heartbreak, of walking through rain.<br />
          No one can see all the battles you face,<br />
          Or how much it takes just to hold your place.<br />
        <br>
          You’ve made it through nights you thought you would end,<br />
          Found strength in a void with no hand to lend.<br />
          And though you’re so tired you’re shaking inside,<br />
          You still choose to breathe, you still haven’t <br/>
        <br>
        <br>
          So here’s to the you they may never see,<br />
          The soul stitched in silence, the will to just be.<br />
          You’re not loud or bright, not polished or grand<br />
          But dammit, you’re strong… <br/>
          You still fucking stand.
